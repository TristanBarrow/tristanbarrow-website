This is my website. I am writing my website to be a fully functional application. It will have three main features.

## My Active Resume 

My resume will be on the site as a reactive webpage that can be edited simply by editing a json file that I will have access to.

## My Blog

I will have a Blog which will be for Software concepts. I will be posting identical or shorter versions of the blog on Medium or another blogging site. 

## Scripture Notes

On my site I will have a scripture reading / note taking application.
